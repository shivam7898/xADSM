Welcome! 

These are the reference notes about Data Analytics using Statistics and R. Goal is to build models based on statistical and machine learning methods. I have tried to keep complete code as a set of 'minimum working example', so that anyone can easily copy and modify it for their own datasets.

Assumption: Working directory has sub-folders named "data", "images", "code", "docs".

Following links contain the ~~completed~~ HTML:

**Caution:**

The HTML File access MathJax via internet to render LaTex Equations. Thus, equations will NOT be rendered properly if the file is viewed offline. Otherwise, the file is a standalone document containing all the relevant images, tables and codes to generate them.

**Disclaimer:** 

This document is a collection of multiple lecture notes, books, and online material. The current status of the document is 'work-in-progress' as it is incomplete and it may contain inconsistencies and errors. 

The code has been checked only on Windows 10. For Mac or Linux, ~~if~~ when you find something that has different output or behavior, please let me know.

**Attribution:**

Proper reference to the original source may sometimes be lacking. This is regrettable and these references will be included in later versions.

Process (3 weeks to 3 months) : Design $\Rightarrow$ CAD (Visual, Material) $\Rightarrow$ Procurement $\Rightarrow$ Warehousing $\Rightarrow$ Dying $\Rightarrow$ Storage of Dyed Yarn $\Rightarrow$ Preparation for Weaving or Hand-Tufting $\Rightarrow$ Wounding $\Rightarrow$ Finishing (edges etc.) $\Rightarrow$ inspection $\Rightarrow$ Dispatch.

Product categories (4 major) - hand-tufted carpets (least effort, most popular), hand knotted carpets (skilled, most expensive), Kilims (woolen, expensive) and Durries (Indian variant)

Company sent samples to the client as per ...

- the latest fiber and color trends
- color and design attributes of their past purchases
- raw material availability in the inventory (preferred, focused effort)
- reproduced the swatches as sent by the client into samples

\textcolor{pink}{Cost-efficient way of selecting appropriate sample designs that could generate maximum revenue.}

Belief: 
carpet attributes could be used for creating customer segments, which in turn could be used for developing models such as classification to identify customer preferences and recommendation systems

\textcolor{pink}{to identify the most important customers and the most important products and find a way to connect the two using suitable attributes from data and appropriate analytics models}

### General Information {.unlisted .unnumbered}

whether fantasy sports was a game of chance or skill, especially whether skill is a dominant factor in winning fantasy sports competition.

(Legal) The decision between skill and chance was to be decided based on whether the skill-based element was dominant over chance in determining the outcome of the game.

If a fantasy sports is chance based, then every user should have an equal probability of winning.

understand the key difference between skill and chance and how to test it using the data. 

To prove that it is skill dominant, we have to prove that users who are scoring high in fantasy sports are playing a strategic game, their selection of players and captain and vice-captain is more knowledge based than random selection. 

If fantasy games involve skill, then we can expect consistency in the performance of the users both low as well as high. Alternatively, we can also check whether a selection specific player increases probability of winning fantasy sports. 


I think our approach should be to identify and test several possible hypotheses to establish whether fantasy sports is skill dominant or chance dominant. 

- Various rounds/match were played. For example, one IPL match would be one round. 
- There were players who were available to be picked up for a round or match. (This number is more than the number of players who would actually play in that match, so it was possible that a player selected by a user in his team may not actually play.) 
- For every round, multiple contests were opened. The contests were of different categories, from free to paid, and various types of playing and winning options (public, private, special). 
- User selected a team for a round and for a contest. 
- There was a player round performance table which indicated how the player performed in the specific round. 
- Teams selected by users were scored on the basis of the selected performance of player in a contest and those team level scores were provided in the contest user table


Few possible hypotheses are listed below: 

1. Users playing free contests are scoring lower than users playing paid contests. This can prove that when users play paid contests, they play more cautiously and strategically, and do not select teams at random. 
2. Scores of randomly selected players can be tested against scores of the teams based on a specific strategy such as selecting players who have performed well in the recent matches. 
3. Is the selection of captains and vice captains of the team random (equal probability)
4. Selection of players and winning or getting high scores are dependent on each other. 
5. As the user plays more games, his chance of winning increases (learning effect).

## Q1 RFM {.tabset .tabset-fade}

As a data scientist, you would like to analyse recency, frequency, and monetary value of an online store. Based on the same, you would like to suggest suitable market segments so that the online store can implement marketing actions efficiently and effectively. In this attempt, use the data (See "B23-RFM.csv"), perform the RFM analysis, provide practical /managerial recommendations. 

- About: [2823, 25]
  - There are NA in 4 Columns, However none of these columns are required for RFM so are being kept.
  - Convert ORDERDATE to Date
- Conclusion
  - We are loosing customers and we need to provide incentives for more frequent visits. It is clearly visible that higher frequency have direct positive correlation with higher monetary purchase.

## Q2 Sports P3

If fantasy-sports is a game of skill, then player performance has a major role in the player getting selected to a team as well as selection of captain or vice-captain. Using the data, can we test if selection of players in a team and getting high scores are dependent on each other. (See Sheet "Qns_5_2SampleTTest" of "B23-FantasySports.xlsx")

- User Category (Top Quartile or Not in Top Quartile) is Categorical 
- Player Selected (Yes or No) is Categorical
- Since both the variables are categorical, we would need to perform Chi-square test
- $P_{\chi^2} < {\alpha} \to {H_0}$ is rejected. Alternative is accepted.
  - Population Proportions are different.
  - The sample results provide sufficient evidence that 'selection of a plyer in the team' and 'user high scores' are dependent on each other.

## Q2 Sports P4

In the data supplied, a few users have selected one of the top three high performing players as captain or vice-captain. There are also users who have not used any of these players as captain or vice-captain. Ramsu claims that choosing high performing players as captain and/or vice-captain has an impact on the scores of the users. Test this claim made by Ramsu and link it to the business problem to make an inference. (See Sheet "Qns_7_Anova" of "B23-FantasySports.xlsx")

- ANOVA Conclusion:
  - Choosing high performing players as captain and/or vice- captain has an impact on the scores of the users.

- \textcolor{pink}{Question:} Coefficients of ANOVA show only "NoSelect" and "ViceCap". "Captain" is missing. What does it mean
  - "ForLater"

```{r 'B23-Q2P4-ANOVA'}
# #NOTE: Because of High number of rows, data was exported to CSV and then Imported
NoSelect <- xxB23Sports_Q7_Anova_NotSelect %>% drop_na(userpoints) %>% select(userpoints)
Captain <- xxB23Sports_Q7_Anova_Captain %>% drop_na(userpoints) %>% select(userpoints)
ViceCap <- xxB23Sports_Q7_Anova_VC %>% drop_na(userpoints) %>% select(userpoints)
#
# #Merge Datasets by Rows
q2p4 <- bind_rows(NoSelect = NoSelect, Captain = Captain, ViceCap = ViceCap, .id = 'Type') 
# ANOVA

## Q3 Champo 

Discuss clustering algorithms that can be used for segmenting customers of Champo Carpets. Apply both k-means and hierarchical clustering techniques and provide insights on the segments we can extract out these data.

Note: Use Sheet "Data Order ONLY" of "B23-Champo.xlsx". It has 13,135 records. Use only the numerical variables (e.g., quantity required, total area, and amount) for performing cluster anlaysis.

- k-means : 3 Clusters looks optimum or we should go with 6
  - Outliers are present and it looks like 6 is better number of clusters
- Hierarchical : Dendrogram was not plotted because of noise
- Conclusion
  - Country USA and Customer TGT have large share on revenue and these should be the focus area.
  - Orders: USA 86% UK 6% by Revenue
  - CustomerCode: "TGT 36%, H-2 12%"
  - Notes:
    - There are Orders having 0 Amount i.e. NO Revenue!
    - 6 Rows are 100% duplicated and some are almost duplicated i.e. DesignName, ColourName changed but no impact on Amount
    - There is a 1-1 Relationship between Country and Customer i.e. a Customer belongs to a specific country only

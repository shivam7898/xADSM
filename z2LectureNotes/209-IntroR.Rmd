# R Introduction (B09, Aug-31) {#b09}

```{r 'B09', include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
sys.source(paste0(.z$RX, "A99Knitr", ".R"), envir = knitr::knit_global())
sys.source(paste0(.z$RX, "000Packages", ".R"), envir = knitr::knit_global())
sys.source(paste0(.z$RX, "A00AllUDF", ".R"), envir = knitr::knit_global())

```

## R Basics

> R is Case-sensitive i.e. c() not ~~C()~~ and View() not ~~view()~~

> Hash Sign "#" comments out anything after it, till the newline. There are no multiline comments.

> Backslash "\\" is reserved to escape the character that follows it.

> Escape key stops the parser i.e. "+" sign where R is waiting for more input before evaluation.

Overview 

- [Change Working Directory](#working-dir-b09 "b09")

### R Studio

- There are 4 Panes -
  1. Top Left - R Editor, Source
  1. Bottom Left - Console, Terminal, ...
  1. Top Right - Environment, History, ...
  1. Bottom Right - Plots, ...
- Sometimes there are only 3 panes i.e. Editor Pane is missing
  - To Open Editor Pane - Create a New R Script by "File | New File | R Script" or \textcolor{pink}{"Ctrl+ Shift+ N"}
- To Modify Pane Settings - Tools | Global Options | Pane Layout

### Shortcuts

- Execute the current expression in Source Pane (Top): "Ctrl+ Enter"
- Execute the current expression in Console Pane (Bottom): "Enter"
- Clear the Console Pane (Bottom): "Ctrl+ L"
- Restart the Current R Session: "Ctrl+ Shift+ F10"
- Create a New R Script: "Ctrl+ Shift+ N"
- Insert "  <- " i.e. Assignment Operator with Space: "Alt+ -"
- Insert " %>% " i.e. Pipe Operator with Space: "Ctrl+ Shift+ M"
- Comment or Uncomment Lines: "Ctrl+ Shift+ C"
- Set Working Directory: "Ctrl+ Shift+ H"
- Search Command History: "Ctrl+ Up Arrow"
- Search Files: "Ctrl+ ."

### Executing an Expression

Execute the current expression in Source Pane (Top) by 'Run' Button or \textcolor{pink}{"Ctrl+ Enter"}

Execute the current expression in Console Pane (Bottom) by "Enter"

### PATH and Working Directory {#working-dir-b09}

Windows 10 uses backslash "\\" for PATH. R, however, uses slash "/". Backslash "\\" is escape character in R.

- So, To provide "C:\\Users\\userName\\Documents" as PATH
  - Use: "C:\\\\Users\\\\userName\\\\Documents"
  - OR: "C:/Users/userName/Documents"
  - OR: "~" Tilde acts as a Reference to Home Directory

In R Studio, Set Working Directory by: 

  - Session | Set Working Directory | Choose Directory or \textcolor{pink}{"Ctrl+ Shift+ H"}

```{r 'B09-SetWorkingDir'}
# #Current Working Directory
getwd()
#
# #R Installation Directory (Old DOS Convention i.e. ~1 after 6 letters)
R.home()
Sys.getenv("R_HOME") 
#
# #This is Wrapped in IF Block to prevent accidental execution
if(FALSE){
# #WARNING: This will change your Working Directory
  setwd("~")
}
```

### Printing

If the R program is written over the console, line by line, then the output is printed automatically i.e. no function needed for printing. This is called \textcolor{pink}{implicit printing}. 

Inside an R Script File, implicit printing does not work and the expression needs to be printed explicitly.

In R, the most common method to print the output 'explicitly' is by the function \textcolor{pink}{print()}. 


```{r 'B09-Printing', eval=FALSE}
# #Implicit Printing: This will NOT be printed to Console, if it is inside an R Script.
"Hello World!"
#
# #Implicit Printing using '()': Same as above
("Hello World!")
#
# #Explicit Printing using print() : To print Objects to Console, even inside an R Script.
print("Hello World!")
## [1] "Hello World!"
```

## Objects

### List ALL Objects 

Everything that exists in R is an object in the sense that it is a kind of data structure that can be manipulated. Expressions for evaluation are themselves objects; Evaluation consists of taking the object representing an expression and returning the object that is the value of that expression.


```{r 'B09-ListObjetcs', eval=FALSE}
# #ls(): List ALL Objects in the Current NameSpace (Environment)
ls()
## character(0)
```

### Assign a Value to an Object 

\textcolor{orange}{Caution:} Always use "<-" for the assignment, NOT the "="

While the "=" can be used for assignment, its usage for assignment is highly discouraged because it may behave differently under certain subtle conditions which are difficult to debug. Convention is to use "=" only during function calls for arguments association (syntactic token).

There are 5 assignment operators (<-, =, <<-, ->, ->>), others are not going to be discussed for now.

All the created objects are listed in the Environment Tab of the Top Right Pane.

```{r 'B09-FirstObject'}
# #Assignment Operator "<-" is used to assign any value (ex: 10) to any object (ex: 'bb')
bb <- 10
#
# #Print Object
print(bb)
```

### Remove an Object

In the Environment Tab, any object can be selected and deleted using Brush.

```{r 'B09-RemoveObject'}
# #Trying to Print an Object 'bb' and Handling the Error, if thrown
tryCatch(print(bb), error = function(e) print(paste0(e)))
#
# #Remove an Object
rm(bb)
#
# #Equivalent
if(FALSE) {rm("bb")} #Same
if(FALSE) {rm(list = "bb")} #Faster, verbose, and would not work without quotes
#
# #Trying to Print an Object 'bb' and Handling the Error, if thrown
tryCatch(print(bb), error = function(e) print(paste0(e)))
```

## Data

```{r 'B09D01', comment="", echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
f_getDef("Data")
```

```{r 'B09D02', comment="", echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
f_getDef("Elements")
```

```{r 'B09D03', comment="", echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
f_getDef("Variable")
```


```{r 'B09D04', comment="", echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
f_getDef("Observation")
```


```{r 'B09D05', comment="", echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
f_getDef("Statistics") #dddd
```

## Vectors {#vectors-b09 .tabset .tabset-fade}

R has 6 basic data types (logical, integer, double, character, complex, and raw). These data types can be combined to form Data Structures (vector, list, matrix, dataframe, factor etc.). Refer [What is a Vector!](#vectors-b10 "b10")

```{definition 'Vectors'}
\textcolor{pink}{Vectors} are the simplest type of data structure in R. A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. 
```

```{definition 'Components'}
Members of a vector are called \textcolor{pink}{components}.
```

Atomic vectors are homogeneous i.e. each component has the same datatype. A vector type can be checked with the \textcolor{pink}{typeof()} or \textcolor{pink}{class()} function. Its length, i.e. the number of elements in the vector, can be checked with the function \textcolor{pink}{length()}.

If the output of an expression does not show numbers in brackets like '[1]' then it is a \textcolor{pink}{'NULL'} type return. [Numbers] show that it is a Vector. Ex: \textcolor{pink}{str()} and \textcolor{pink}{cat()} outputs are of NULL Type.

Use function \textcolor{pink}{c()} to create a vector (or a list) - 

- In R, a literal character or number is just a vector of length 1. So, c() 'combines' them together in a series of 1-length vectors. 
- c() neither creates nor concatenates the vectors, it combines them. Thus, it combines list into a list and vectors into a vector.
- In R, list is a 'Vector' but not an 'Atomic Vector'.
- All arguments are coerced to a common type which is the type of the returned value.
- All attributes (e.g. dim) except 'names' are removed.
- The output type is determined from the highest type of the components in the hierarchy `NULL` < `raw` < `logical` < `integer` < `double` < `complex` < `character` < `list` < `expression`.
- To "index a vector" means, to address specific elements by using square brackets, i.e. x[10] means the ${10^{th}}$ element of vector 'x'.

\textcolor{orange}{Caution:} Colon ":" might produce unexpected length of vectors (in case of 0-length vectors). Suggestion: Use colon only with hardcoded numbers i.e. "1:10" is ok, "1:n" is dangerous and should be avoided.

\textcolor{orange}{Caution:} seq() function might produce unexpected type of vectors (in case of 1-length vectors). Suggestion: Use seq_along(), seq_len().

### Atomic Vectors {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-Vectors'}
# #To know about an Object: str(), class(), length(), dim(), typeof(), is(), attributes(), names()
# #Integer: To declare as integer "L" (NOT "l") is needed
ii_int <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L)
str(ii_int)
#
# #Double (& Default)
dd_dbl <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
str(dd_dbl)
#
# #Character
cc_chr <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
str(cc_chr)
#
# #Logical
ll_lgl <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
str(ll_lgl)
```

### Integer {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-Integer'}
# #Integer Vector of Length 1
nn <- 5L
#
# #Colon ":" Operator - Avoid its usage
str(c(1:nn))
c(typeof(pi:6), typeof(6:pi))
#
# #seq() - Avoid its usage
str(seq(1, nn))
str(seq(1, nn, 1))
str(seq(1, nn, 1L))
str(seq(1L, nn, 1L))
#
# #seq_len()
str(seq_len(nn))
```

### Double {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-Double'}
str(seq(1, 5, 1))
```

### Character {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-Character'}
str(letters[1:5])
```

### Logical {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-Logical'}
str(1:5 %% 2 == 0)
```

## DataFrame {#dataframe-b09}

```{r 'B09-DataFrame'}
# #Create Two Vectors
income <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "female", "male")
#
# #Create a DataFrame
bb <- data.frame(income, gender)
#
# #Print or View DataFrame
#View(bb)
print(bb)
#
# #Struture
str(bb)
#
# #Names
names(bb)
```

## Save and Load an R Script {#script-b09 .tabset .tabset-fade}

R Script file extension is ".R"

\textcolor{pink}{"Ctrl+ S"} will Open Save Window at Working Directory.

\textcolor{pink}{"Ctrl+ O"} will Open the Browse Window at Working Directory.

### Check File Exist {.unlisted .unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-CheckFileExists'}
# #Subdirectory "data" has data files like .csv .rds .txt .xlsx
# #Subdirectory "code" has scripts files like .R 
# #Subdirectory "images" has images like .png
#
# #Check if a File exists 
path_relative <- "data/aa.xlsx" #Relative Path
#
if(file.exists(path_relative)) {
    cat("File Exists\n") 
  } else {
    cat(paste0("File does not exist at ", getwd(), "/", path_relative, "\n"))
  }
#
if(exists("XL", envir = .z)) {
  cat(paste0("Absolute Path exists as: ", .z$XL, "\n"))
  path_absolute <- paste0(.z$XL, "aa", ".xlsx") #Absolute Path
  #
  if(file.exists(path_absolute)) {
    cat("File Exists\n") 
  } else {
    cat(paste0("File does not exist at ", path_absolute, "\n"))
  }
} else {
  cat(paste0("Object 'XL' inside Hidden Environment '.z' does not exist. \n", 
             "It is probably File Path of the Author, Replace the File Path from Your own Directory\n"))
}
```

### Aside {.unlisted .unnumbered}

- This section is NOT useful for general reader and can be safely ignored. It contains my notes related to building this book. These are useful only for someone who is building his own book. (Shivam)
- "Absolute Path" is NOT a problem in Building a Book, Knitting a Chapter, or on Direct Console.
- "Absolute Path" has a problem only when Running code chunk directly from the Rmd document and when the Rmd document is inside a sub-directory (like in this book), then only the Working Directory differs.

## CSV Import /Export {.tabset .tabset-fade}

\textcolor{pink}{write.csv()} and \textcolor{pink}{read.csv()} combination can be used to export data and import it back into R. But, it has some limitations - 

- Re-imported object "yy_data" will NOT match with the original object "xx_data" under default conditions
  1. write.csv(), by default, write row.names (or row numbers) in the first column. 
      - So, either use row.names = FALSE while writing 
      - OR use row.names = 1 while reading
  1. row.names attribute is always read as 'character' even though originally it might be 'integer'. 
      - So, that attribute needs to be coerced
  1. colClasses() needs to be defined to match with the original dataframe, otherwise 'income' is read as 'integer', even though originally it was 'numeric'.
  1. Conclusion: Avoid, if possible.
- Alternative: \textcolor{pink}{saveRDS()} and \textcolor{pink}{readRDS()}
  - Functions to write a single R object to a file, and to restore it.
  - Imported /Exported objects are always identical


```{conjecture 'cannot-open-connection'}
\textcolor{brown}{Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : cannot open the connection}
```

- Check the path, file name, & file extension for typing mistakes
- Execute getwd(), just before the command, to confirm that the working directory is as expected

### write.csv() {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-WriteToCSV'}

## Packages {#packages-b09 .tabset .tabset-fade}

```{definition 'Packages'}
\textcolor{pink}{Packages} are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. 
```

Packages include reusable functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.

In R Studio: Packages Tab | Install | Package Name = "psych" | Install

- Packages are installed from \textcolor{pink}{CRAN} Servers
  - To Change Server: Tools | Global Options | Packages | Primary CRAN Repository | Change | CRAN Mirrors (Select Your Preference) | OK
  - All Installed Packages are listed under Packages Tab
  - All Loaded Packages are listed under Packages Tab with a Tick Mark
  - Some packages are dependent on other packages and those are also installed when 'dependencies = TRUE'
  - If a package is NOT installed properly, it will show error when loaded by \textcolor{pink}{library()}

### Install Packages {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-InstallPackage', eval=FALSE}
if(FALSE){
  # #WARNING: This will install packages and R Studio will NOT work for that duration
  # #Install Packages and their dependencies
  install.packages("psych", dependencies = TRUE)
}
```

### Load Packages {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-Library', eval=FALSE}
# #Load a Package with or without Quotes
library(readxl)
library("readr")
```

### Load Multiple Packages {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-LoadPackages', eval=FALSE}
# #Load Multiple Packages
pkg_chr <- c("ggplot2", "tibble", "tidyr", "readr", "dplyr")
#lapply(pkg_chr, FUN = function(x) {library(x, character.only = TRUE)})
#
# #Load Multiple Packages, Suppress Startup Messages, and No console output
invisible(lapply(pkg_chr, FUN = function(x) {
  suppressMessages(library(x, character.only = TRUE))}))
```

### Detach Package {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-Detach', eval=FALSE}
# #Detach a package
#detach("package:psych", unload = TRUE)
#
# #Search Package in the already loaded packages
pkg_chr <- "psych"
if (pkg_chr %in% .packages()) {
# #Detach a package that has been loaded previously
  detach(paste0("package:", pkg_chr), character.only = TRUE, unload = TRUE)
}
```

### Install Older Version of Package {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-OlderVersion', eval=FALSE}
# #When Update of a Package breaks your code and you want to postpone that debugging
# #Get the URL of older version of the Package from CRAN
packageurl <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/latex2exp/latex2exp_0.5.0.tar.gz"
#
if(FALSE) {# #WARNING: Installation may take some time.
  install.packages(packageurl, repos = NULL, type = "source")  
}
```

### Package Version {.unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-PackageVersion'}
packageVersion("dplyr")

```

### Rtools4 on Windows {.unnumbered}

\textcolor{orange}{Caution:} It is NOT recommeded. However the instructions are available at [Rtools4](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40.html "https://cran.r-project.org")

```{r 'B09-RTools', eval=FALSE}
# #Only for the debugging purposes, install from GitHub.

  Sys.which("make") #"D:\\Installations\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe"
  devtools::install_github("stefano-meschiari/latex2exp", ref = "0.9.3") 
}
```

### Update Packages {.unnumbered}

- Update Packages from RStudio in general
- However there are Packages that come together with R. Those needs to be updated with each R update
  - Run R as an administrator.
  - Packages | Updaate Packages
    - If it asks for "Do you want to use Personal Directory" - Decline. It is another headache.
    - If Some Packages fail to update in Administrator Mode, Rerun the update one by one. It works.


## Import Flights Data {#flights-b09 .tabset .tabset-fade}

To Import Excel in R Studio : Environment | Dropdown | From Excel | Browse

Object imported by \textcolor{pink}{read.csv()} i.e. 'mydata' is NOT same as the one imported by \textcolor{pink}{read_excel()} i.e. 'mydata_xl'

- read_excel() imports as a Tibble which is a modern view of dataframe. It is more restrictive so that output would be more predictable.
- read.csv(), if possible, imports as integer (ex: 'year' column). But, read_excel() imports, if possible, as a numeric.
- Further, read_excel() has imported many columns as 'character' that should have been 'numeric' ex: dep_time
- NOTE: To complete the set \textcolor{pink}{readr::read_csv()} is also covered here which reads CSV and generates a Tibble.

All of these objects can be converted into any other form as needed i.e. dataframe to tibble or vice-versa.

## Attach a Dataset

\textcolor{orange}{Caution:} Attaching a Dataset should be avoided to prevent unexpected behaviour due to 'masking'. Using full scope resolution i.e. 'data_frame$column_header' would result in fewer bugs. However, if a Dataset has been attached, please ensure that it is detached also.

\textcolor{orange}{Caution:} If a dataset is attached more than once e.g. 4 times, please note that there will be 4 copies attached to the environment. It can be checked with search(). Each needs to be detached.

```{r 'B09-AttachDataSet', eval=FALSE}
if(FALSE){
  # #WARNING: Attaching a Dataset is discouraged because of 'masking'
  # #'dep_time' is Column Header of a dataframe 'mydata'
  tryCatch(str(dep_time), error = function(e) print(paste0(e)))
## [1] "Error in str(dep_time): object 'dep_time' not found\n"
  # #Attach the Dataset
  attach(mydata)

  # #But, there are other datasets also, attaching another one results in MESSAGE
  attach(mydata_xl)
## The following objects are masked from mydata:
##
##     air_time, arr_delay, arr_time, carrier, day, dep_delay, dep_time, dest,
##     distance, flight, hour, minute, month, origin, sched_arr_time,
##     sched_dep_time, tailnum, time_hour, year

#
# #'mydata_xl$dep_time' masked the already present 'mydata$dep_time'.
# #Thus now it is showing as 'chr' in place of original 'int'
# #Column Header Names can be highly varied and those will silently mask other variable
# #Hence, attaching a dataset would result in random bugs or unexpected behaviours

## Package "psych" {.tabset .tabset-fade}

- \textcolor{pink}{pairs.panels()} -
  - It shows a scatter plot of matrices, with bivariate scatter plots below the diagonal, histograms on the diagonal, and the Pearson correlation above the diagonal.
    - Calculation time is highly dependent on dataset size and type 
    - See Figure \@ref(fig:B09P01)
    - Conclusion: "air_time and distance are highly correlated"

```{conjecture 'need-finite-xlim'}
\textcolor{brown}{Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 'xlim' values}
```

- In this case, the error will be observed if the output of pairs.panels() is assigned to an object.
- Direct console output (i.e. no assignment) should not be a problem

```{conjecture 'par-old-par'}
\textcolor{brown}{Error in par(old.par) : invalid value specified for graphical parameter "pin"}
```

- The Error is generally observed because the Plot does not have enough space in R Studio (Lower Right Pane). In general, it is NOT a problem. It is an error of map() xlim[1] should be less than xlim[2].
- Use larger window size or control image size output

## Operators in R

- There are multiple \textcolor{pink}{infix binary operators}
- \textcolor{pink}{a %in% b} : returns a logical vector indicating if there is a match or not for its left operand
- \textcolor{pink}{%/%} and \textcolor{pink}{%%} perform integer division and modular division respectively
- \textcolor{pink}{%o%} gives the outer product of arrays.
- \textcolor{pink}{%*%} performs matrix multiplication.
- \textcolor{pink}{%x%} performs the Kronecker product of arrays.
- Magritter Pipe is given by \textcolor{pink}{%>%}
- There are other pipes and other packages also but this is general summary.

## Printing Decimal Numbers in R {.tabset .tabset-fade}

- By default, R gives numbers in Scientic Notation. 
  - Personally, it is irritating to read p-values, residuals etc. of model output and to convert them everywhere.
  - Defaults can be changed, so that Scientific Notation is disabled
  - Functions \textcolor{pink}{round()}, \textcolor{pink}{signif()} does not have 'E' option
  - Functions \textcolor{pink}{sprintf()}, \textcolor{pink}{prettyNum()}, \textcolor{pink}{format()} converts to 'character'
    - And there is a \textcolor{pink}{formatC()} which does not get affected by global options()


```{definition 'Rounding'}
\textcolor{pink}{Rounding} means replacing a number with an approximate value that has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation.
```

```{definition 'Significant-Digits'}
\textcolor{pink}{Significant digits}, (or significant figures, or precision or resolution), of a number in positional notation are digits in the number that are reliable and necessary to indicate the quantity of something. 
```

- Significant digits
  - Even when some of the digits are not certain, as long as they are reliable, they are considered significant because they indicate the actual volume within the acceptable degree of uncertainty. 
  - Not Significant digits
    - Leading Zeroes e.g. 013 kg or 0.056 m (= 56 mm) both have 2 significant digits
    - Trailing zeros when they are merely placeholders 
    
### Change Defaults {.unlisted .unnumbered}

```{r 'B09-SciFi', eval=FALSE}
if(FALSE) {# #Disable Scientific Notation 'E' in R. Run Once for current session. 
# #Put it in .Rprofile File to always execute this.

}
#
if(FALSE) {# #To revert back to original defaults
  options(scipen = 0, digits = 7)
